  title: Freedom

A while ago I had a blog. Since then the server got migrated, then deleted by the hosting company with no backups 
(thanks [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com), great job).  Actually, that's not strictly true, I *do* have a backup somewhere but like
that [quote on bash.org](http://bash.org/?5273) I know it's in the house somewhere, I just don't know where it is.

There was a lot of nonsense on the blog anyway so I see this as my being freed from the shackles of my previous self.

Hurrah, to new beginnings.
